# Unbiased dental template
In this study, we develop an unbiased dental template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with guidance of teeth segmentation.
First, to address the challenges, we propose to enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning.
Then, we further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental template can be generated.
By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models.
A total of 159 CBCT images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions.
